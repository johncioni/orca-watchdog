  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      orca-watchdog is installed but does nothing until you start it.
      Nothing is registered with launchd and no terminal is touched yet.

      To turn it on (two steps):

        orca-watchdog doctor   # check macOS, Node, Orca, launchd
        orca-watchdog start    # register the LaunchAgent; runs every 5 min

      It needs the Orca CLI (`orca`) on your PATH, or set ORCA_CLI to its path.
      Before `brew upgrade`, run `orca-watchdog stop`, then `start` again.
